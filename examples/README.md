# Protos examples

This directory is a task-oriented cookbook: **how do I do X in Protos?** It is inspired by the task-oriented organization of Rosetta Code rather than by a linear tutorial.

All Protos source files use the canonical `.protos` extension. Examples are non-normative; `spec/` remains authoritative.

Print-dependent cookbook programs are maintained as executable standalone-CLI sources. The CLI regression suite discovers every `.protos` file in this tree containing `print(` and executes it unchanged, including concurrent examples whose `Future.value()` suspension must run inside the Process RootActor task.
